#Arguments:
# file_path= absolute path ( on localhost) of the folder containing all *.c files

# To create a directory or pass file the path must be absolute ~exec_dir where
#  exec_dir= (user)/efs/app_name/
# however, in a shell command, the current directory is ~(user)/ so cd exec_dir yields
# ~(user)/(user)/efs/app_name/, which does not exist
# There are two options:
# 1- Hardcode the directory
# 2- change to home director and re-use the exec_dir <- Option used
